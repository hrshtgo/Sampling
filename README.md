# Sampling
A python program that balances imbalanced data and applies different sampling techniques and ML Models to determine which technique and model combined gives a higher accuracy using TOPSIS.

## Steps
* Converted the data-set to balanced class data-set.
* Created 5 different samples using different techniques.
* Applied 5 different sampling techniques on 5 different machine learning models.
* Determined which sampling technique gives higher accuracy on which model.
